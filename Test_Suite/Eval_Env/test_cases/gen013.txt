Source: JR and his wife
JR and his wife were attending an outdoor company picnic earlier this afternoon. As the
patient was eating a BBQ lunch and drinking beer (three in total); he began to feel that his
surroundings were spinning. He reports that he felt as if he were about to pass out so he
put his head down on the table and lost consciousness. A few minutes later; he regained
consciousness and was surrounded by family and friends trying to cool him off with ice
packs. The patient said that after fainting; he felt no pain but did experience a soreness in
the center of his chest and felt fatigued and “worn out.” He also reported feeling like he
“wasn’t getting enough air.” When bystanders attempted to elevate his legs; it aggravated
the patient’s chronic lower back pain and his back and legs hurt. The patient was
transported to the VA emergency room via ambulance. He was given fluids by paramedics
and said that this made him feel slightly better. Currently; the patient continues to feel
weak and “out of it.” He also reports a continuing occasional strange feeling in his chest
which he describes as a “dull pressure.” The patient’s PMH is not significant for cardiac or
pulmonary problems. He said that he has not fainted in the past; but did report feeling weak
and slightly dizzy when attempting to move a boat a few months ago. This morning; the
patient awoke with a headache and tool Tylenol. He had one cup of coffee. 
PMH:
1. Secondary Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the neck – The patient was diagnosed in May of
1993 after discovering a mass on his neck. The enlarged lymph nodes was biopsied. The
patient underwent a radical neck resection with reconstructive surgery of the neck and jaw
and radiation. His physicians have classified him as being in remission for the past six years.
2. Hypothyroidism – Diagnosed in 1995 after radiation therapy; managed with medication.
3. Lower back pain and leg pain – The patient reports two herniated discs in the lumbar
spine that cause him nearly constant pain since being hit by a car while driving a motorcycle
on 08/19/1982. The accident also resulted in a shattered tibia and fibula in the left side. His
left leg is shorter than the right and over time this has resulted in some pelvic deformities.
4. Migraines – With auras and occasional nausea and vomiting. The patient experienced
some migraines as a child. He was symptom free from age 16 to 40. Currently; he
experiences a headache approximately every six months. The headaches are managed with
several medications. In the past few months; the patient was admitted to the hospital for a
migraine headache unresponsive to medication.
5. Kidney stones – Patient has had 3-4 kidney stones over the past few years. All of them
were passed out. His last kidney stone was in December; 2004. The one prior to that was in
2001.
