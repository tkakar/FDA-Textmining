Patient BV is a 67-year-old woman who had been in good health when routine mammography in October of 1991 revealed a suspicious breast mass. In late 1991 she underwent biopsy and lumpectomy, with removal of a 2.1 cm. tumor confirmed as in situ and infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Though no nodes were sampled, a bone scan in December 1991 as part of routine follow-up testing demonstrated increased uptake in the right proximal femur. An MRI in January 1992 documented a lesion on the right greater trochanter consistent with metastatic disease. The official report reads. A solitary lesion is noted distal to the right greater trochanterâ�¦most likely representing a metastatic lesion
The patient did meet with an orthopedic surgeon who suggested a course of aggressive surgery with hip replacement followed by radiation to the hip. Her breast surgeon insisted BV proceed with mastectomy and subsequent radiation to the chest wall. However, after learning of our approach, BV refused all further conventional interventions, instead choosing to proceed with my treatment.
When I first saw BV in early 1992, she reported severe fatigue and chronic right hip pain, severe enough that she had gone on disability from her job. After beginning her nutritional regimen, she proved to be a very determined, compliant patient. During her first months on therapy, she suffered migratory aches and pains, particularly severe in the right shoulder and hip, but these gradually resolved. In fact, after a period of some months she felt so well she returned to work full time.
Repeat bone scans in May 1992 five months after BV began her treatment with me showed, according to the report, No definite evidence of metastatic disease. A follow-up scan in June 1993 was again clear, and today, nearly 15 years after she first consulted me, BV remains compliant with her full regimen, and disease free.
Her case is very straightforward. At the time of diagnosis, a bone scan and MRI documented a large tumor in her hip that regressed while she followed only her nutritional program.
Elder et al report a median survival of 2.4 years for women with breast cancer metastatic to bone (3), somewhat better statistics than for those diagnosed with brain or liver metastases. However, these numbers reference patients aggressively treated with conventional modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, all of which BV refused.
