Mr. S is a 70 yr old male with known coronary artery disease who is: 
-Status Post 3 vessel CABG in 4/82. 
-Suffered recurrent chest pain in 12/93 which ultimately lead to catheterization and stent placement in a mid-LAD lesion. 
-Recathed in 1/95 for recurrent chest pain at rest; at that time there was no significant change compared to cath of 12/93; patient was therefore continued on medical therapy. 
-Known to have an Ejection Fraction of 30% with inferior and lateral akinesis by echo in 2/96 
-No prior episodes of heart failure. 
-Last Exercise Tolerance Test was performed in 1/97 and showed no ischemia at 10 METS of activity.
Mr. S was well until last week (9/97), when he began to experience recurrent episodes of chest pain, exactly like his past angina, after walking only one block. This represented a significant change in his anginal pattern, which is normally characterized as mild discomfort which occurs after walking vigorously for 8 or 9 blocks. In addition, 1 day prior to admission, the pain briefly occurred while the patient was reading a book. He has also noted swelling in his legs over this same time period and has awakened several times in the middle of the night, gasping for breath. In order to breathe comfortably at night, Mr. S now requires the use of 3 pillows, whereas in the past he was always able to lie flat on his back without difficulty. Mr. S is known to have poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day. He denies fevers, chills, cough, wheezing, nausea vomiting or other complaints.
