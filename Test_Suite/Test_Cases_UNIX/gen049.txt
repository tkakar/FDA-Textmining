Patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of I-131-induced hypothyroidism years ago who presents with increased weight and edema over the last few weeks with a 25-pound weight gain, putting her at 192 pounds. 

MEDICATIONS: Include levothyroxine 300 mcg daily, since 4/6/2015

A few weeks ago, around the start of the levothyoxine, significant weight gain started occuring (more weight gain than usual). The levothyroxine was replaced with Synthroid 80 mcg daily, and after a few days the weight started leveling out at 178lbs. There are no plans for the patient to return to levothyroxine.
