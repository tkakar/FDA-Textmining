Mr. Womack is a 45 yo man with a history of recurrent pulmonary emboli (PE) who presents with chest pain. Two years prior to admission, he suffered a compound femur fracture from a motor vehicle accident. He course was complicated by a PE. He since has been treated with coumadin and has demonstrated noncompliance with the medication leading to two subsequent admissions for PE. He was in his usual state of health until today when, while sitting in a chair, he developed the abrupt onset of a diffuse left anterior chest pain without radiation, associated with shortness of breath. The pain was 5/10, described as sharp and constant. It was unaffected by position. There was no fever, cough, sputum, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, bloating, or hematemesis. He has no prior history of trauma to the chest, prior coronary artery disease or anxiety. Because these symptoms did not improve and were similar to prior PE's that he experienced, he went to his local physician who hospitalized him at St. Mary's Hospital. Evaluation there revealed a swollen left lower extremity, a sub-therapeutic prothrombin time and a moderate probability VQ scan. He was given the diagnosis of PE and transferred to our hospital for further evaluation.
